/**
 * Java's ThreadPoolExecutor is a great library, offering some very useful features. New tasks
 * (runnables) are submitted via ThreadPoolExecutor 's execute(...) method, which hands off
 * the task to one of its available workers or queue it.
 * <p>
 * However, if all the workers are busy, the pool is at its capacity and the queue is full, the
 * task is rejected and execute(...) throws RejectedExecutionException. The responsibility then
 * shifts back to the Caller thread which invoked execute(...) method to deal with the task
 * rejection.
 * <p>
 * Often times, it is desirable to block (the execute(...) method) Caller if the task cannot be
 * accepted and to keep retrying task submission. There are several ways to achieve this, as
 * explained in the article:
 * http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2008/10/23/creating-a-notifying-blocking-thread-pool-executor.html
 * <p>
 * The BlockingThreadPoolExecutor class in this file implements a Blocking ThreadPoolExecutor as
 * explained in the above article. We attach a customer RejectedExecutionHandler to ThreadPoolExecutor
 * which keeps retrying task submission forever (until the thread-pool is alive). In addition, on
 * each subsequent rejection or acceptance, handler methods are called giving them a chance to take
 * some application defined action.
 * <p>
 * Note: It is trivial to modify RejectedExecutionHandler to give up task submission after a specified
 * number of retries or if a timeout occurs, throwing RejectedExecutionException.
